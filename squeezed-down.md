## 1. How to Respond to the Investor (Damage Control)

The key is to validate the frustration, explain the mechanics transparently, and reinforce their value to the platform — without sounding robotic or dismissive.

### ✉️ Sample Response

> **Subject:** About Your Allocation in Recent Deals
>
> Hi [Investor Name],
>
> I want to thank you for reaching out and also acknowledge the frustration you're feeling — it's completely valid. We truly value your continued interest and commitment to investing at the $100K level, and we understand how disappointing it can be to consistently receive a lower allocation.
>
> In the deals you're referencing, the total investor demand significantly exceeded the available allocation. As a result, our system had to prorate everyone’s requests based on historical averages to maintain fairness across the platform.
>
> While that approach helps ensure consistency over time, we recognize that it doesn't always reflect a given investor's current level of interest or ability to deploy capital. We're actively reviewing our allocation logic and are exploring ways to better balance historical participation with recent signals of intent — especially for highly engaged investors like yourself.
>
> We’ll keep you updated as we roll out improvements, and in the meantime, please know that we’re always happy to discuss ways to prioritize your participation where possible.
>
> Thank you again for your partnership — your feedback helps make the platform better for everyone.
>
> Best,  
> [Your Name]  
> [Your Title]

## 🧮 2. Systemic Solution: Rethinking Proration Logic

Currently, allocations are based only on **historical average investment size**, which tends to penalize:
- Newer investors ramping up,
- Investors increasing appetite,
- Loyal investors in crowded deals.

### 🔄 Suggested Change: **Weighted Hybrid Proration**

Instead of purely historical averages, consider a **weighted formula**:

```
proration_score = α * historical_average + (1 - α) * current_requested_amount
```

Where:
- `α` is a tunable weight (e.g., 0.7 = 70% history, 30% request)
- Investors with a strong track record still get priority
- But high current intent (e.g., larger requests) has more say

This encourages investors to stay engaged, but also lets them scale up over time and avoids hard caps that feel arbitrary.

### 🛠️ Optional Enhancements:
- **Cap minimum allocations** (e.g., never less than $X unless totally oversubscribed)
- Offer **early commit tiers** (e.g., prioritize those who commit early or subscribe to a “priority pool”)
- Use **rolling average** instead of lifetime average to reflect evolving investment behavior
