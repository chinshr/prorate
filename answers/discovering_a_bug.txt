Prompt
~~~~~~

Suppose we discover a bug with our algorithm and investors for two deals had incorrect
allocations. This means that some of the investors ended up investing more than they were allowed to
while others invested less than they were allowed to. One of deals happened two years ago and the
other one happened two weeks ago. Please describe, in detail, how would you go about correcting this
issue and how would you communicate this to the affected customers.

Response
~~~~~~~~


## 1. INVESTIGATE & VERIFY

### Goal: Understand the extent and root cause of the bug.
- **Reproduce the bug** in a safe environment.
- **Audit historical allocations** for the affected deals — compare actual invested amounts to what should’ve been allocated based on correct proration logic.
- Identify:
  - Which investors over-invested and by how much.
  - Which investors under-invested and by how much.
- Determine **how the bug was introduced** (e.g., bad rounding logic, misinterpretation of historical averages, faulty formula, etc.).
- Check whether **other deals** might have been affected using the same logic.
- What are the learnings
- What are the actions from the learnings

## 2. CORRECT THE ISSUE
### Goal: Make things right in a fair, transparent, and legal way.

### For the recent deal (2 weeks ago):
- **Under-allocated investors**: If there's still room in the startup's cap table or you can adjust post-facto, offer to increase their allocation (with their consent and coordination with the startup).
- **Over-allocated investors**: If possible, refund the overage, or offer a choice between:
  - keeping the excess as an intentional oversubscription,
  - or reallocating to another deal.

### For the old deal (2 years ago):
- Changing past allocations is tricky (might involve tax or legal complications), so:
  - Consider **compensating under-allocated investors** with fee discounts, priority allocations in upcoming deals, or direct credit.
  - For **over-allocated investors**, you likely *can’t* change the allocation retroactively, so just acknowledge the error but let them keep the stake.

## 3. COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS
### Goal: Be transparent, build trust, and make amends.

### Principles:
- Honest and humble tone — take full responsibility.
- Empathy — acknowledge that this impacts their financial decisions.
- Concrete — clearly explain what happened and how you're fixing it.
- Offer options — let them choose the most comfortable resolution where possible.
